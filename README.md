Set Up
1.	Download the program, it is named textProcessing.jar
2.	In the folder that the program file is saved create a folder called process, this is were you will store all the text files you want to run through the program
3.	Make sure that a command line interface is installed on your machine
4.	Make sure that java is installed on your machine
If you are running this through eclipse the process folder needs to be created at the same level as the src and bin folders.
 
If you need help with the command line interface this page is a good reference https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-interface.

Running the Program
To run the program you will need to open up your command line interface. Once this has opened navigate (in the command line) to the folder that textProcessing.jar is saved.  
Once you get to that folder enter this command into the command line “java -cp textProcessing.jar convertingStringToChar.index”
 

This will start up the program.
On start up you are presented with two options, enter text directly to the console or read the text from a file. Enter 1 to input text directly to the console or enter 2 to read text from a file.
 
To end the program hit enter without having entered anything to the console, this closes the program.



Processing a file
To process a file you must first make sure that the text is in a .txt file and is in the “process” folder you created earlier.

After choosing 2 you will be prompted to enter the name of your file. Just enter the name of the file, this is case sensitive so make sure that the name is the exact same name. There is no need to add .txt to the end of the file name.
 
If your file is found the program will continue to the next stage.

Processing text directly entered to the program
 
If you want to enter text directly to the console, enter 1 on the start up screen
When you enter 1 it will prompt you to start entering text. You can enter as many lines of text as you want.
When you have finished entering text enter “exit” or just hit enter into the console. This will move you along to the next stage of the program.
 

Processing the text
After you have chosen to read text from a file or entered text directly to the console you are presented with the same two options. Process the characters of the text or the words of the text.  To process the characters of the entered text enter 1, to process the words, enter 2.






If you want to process the characters of the text , enter 1. This will process the characters of the text and give you the output.
 

If you want to process the words of the text , enter 2. This will process the words of the text and give you the output.
 


Processing either the words or characters will then present you with three options. You can either process the thing you didn’t last time, restart the program and start with new text or exit the program.
